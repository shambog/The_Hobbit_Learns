# The_Hobbit_Learns
## Reinforcement learning using the Q-learning approach of rewards.


The Hobbit is excited to begin his treasure hunt after seeing Thror's map. The journey is full of obstacles but the Hobbit learns from his mistakes and finally finds the treasure overcoming all the obstacles that came along the way.

In this project, we are implementing the Q-Learning algorithm. It is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm where the goal is to learn a policy which tells our Hobbit what action to take in which situatuon. The algorithm does not require a model of the environment and can learn from rewards.

In this diagram, the RED object is our Hobbit, the ORANGE ones are the obstacles and the GREEN circle is our treasure.
